# libgdx-jbullet
A fork of the Bullet physics library java port by Jezek2 to LibGdx library, to allow GWT support under Apache 2.0 license. 

This is a fork of [GBullet](https://code.google.com/p/gbullet/), a GWT port of [JBullet](http://jbullet.advel.cz/) which is a port of the [Bullet Physics engine](http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/) using the [VecMath](https://java.net/projects/vecmath) library. All these libraries are under ZLib license except Vecmath which is GPL 2. That's the reason I made this fork ; it frees you from the vecmath dependency and use the math classes from LibGdx which is under Apache License 2.0, hence allowing commercia use.

## History

This is the first, pre-alpha release, largely under tested, without any support, likely full of bugs and such,... 
Think twice before using !

## Why would you use this library, and why would you not ?

This library was developped for the following reasons :
- optimize Android deployment size; the native Bullet port adds a few Mb to your APK. If you want to keep small, this version used with ProGuard will do wonders,
- enable HTML backend through GWT.

The counterparts are the following :
- absolutely no support; use at your own risk !
- the port lags behing the Bullet library; the port is somewhat at the level of the 2.72 version while the native port follows the latest Bullet version
- likely far slower than the native port.

A side benefit of this library is that it is full java so you don't have to go through the native memory management.

You can see it in action in [this published game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.softmotion.fpack.lite).

## Changes from the original port by Jezek2

- Added setAngularFactor et setLinearFactor in order to enable 2D use along 3D use (see [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.softmotion.fpack.lite); dice use 3D physics, Air Hockey and Passe Trappe use 2D physics).
